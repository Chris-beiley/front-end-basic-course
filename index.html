                <h2>Early Origins</h2>
                <p class="introduction">
                    The London Library was established in 1841 at a time when there were no lending libraries in
                    London
                    and
                    before state-funded libraries existed. Frustrated by being unable to borrow books in London,
                    author
                    <a href="https://www.londonlibrary.co.uk/thomas-carlyle"> Thomas Carlyle</a> began gathering
                    support
                    for a lending library and created a founding committee in April 1840 to oversee the work of
                    raising
                    launch funds. Chaired by Lord Lyttleton, its members
                    included John Forster (Charles Dickens’ greatest friend and unofficial business manager), MP
                    William
                    Gladstone,
                    poet and politician Richard Monckton Milnes, diplomat William Christie and biographer James
                    Spedding.

                <p id="introductionParagraph">
                    The committee’s year long drive for funds was met with the contribution of 382 founder
                    members whose
                    support enabled the Library to open to the public on 3rd May 1841. Among the founding
                    subscribers
                    were
                    Charles Dickens, John Stuart Mill, Harriet Martineau, radical MP Joseph Hume, future Prime
                    Minister
                    Lord
                    John Russell, Dickens’ publishers William Chapman and Edward Hall and his illustrator for
                    Barnaby
                    Rudge
                    and the Old Curiosity Shop, George Cattermole.
                    Their backing enabled the Library to amass a starting collection of 2,000 books, handpicked
                    by
                    Gladstone, Mill and the Italian revolutionary Mazzini. Prince Albert donated £50, a number
                    of books
                    and
                    became the Library’s first patron.
                    The Library initially rented cheap premises in 45 Pall Mall (above a former Georgian
                    gambling den)
                    before moving to its more familiar location in St James’s Square five years later. From the
                    outset
                    it
                    became a crucible for emerging talent and growing reputations. Charles Darwin joined within
                    months
                    of
                    the Library opening, William Thackeray soon after.
                    Since these early origins, thousands of the world’s greatest writers and thinkers have been
                    intimately
                    associated with this extraordinary institution, passionately supporting it and drawing
                    heavily on
                    its
                    collection to produce their work.
